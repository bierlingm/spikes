## What Is This?

Spikes is a feedback tool for AI-assisted development. It lets reviewers leave targeted feedback directly on web pages — no screenshots, no "that button over there", no lost context.

Click any element. Rate it. Comment. Spikes captures the exact CSS selector, bounding box, and page context. Your AI agent gets structured JSON it can act on immediately.

**No accounts required. No build step. Works on `file://`, localhost, anywhere.**

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://spikes.sh/install.sh | sh
# Or: cargo install spikes-cli
```

### 2. Add the widget to your HTML

```bash
spikes inject ./mockups/        # Injects widget script tag
spikes serve                    # http://localhost:3847
```

### 3. Collect and use feedback

```bash
spikes list                     # See all feedback
spikes list --json              # Feed to your agent
spikes list --rating no         # Find problems
spikes hotspots                 # Elements with most feedback
spikes resolve <id>             # Mark items done
```

---

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `spikes init` | Create `.spikes/` directory with config |
| `spikes list` | List feedback (`--json`, `--page`, `--reviewer`, `--rating`, `--unresolved`) |
| `spikes show <id>` | Show single spike details |
| `spikes export` | Export to JSON/CSV/JSONL/Cursor/Claude context |
| `spikes hotspots` | Elements with most feedback |
| `spikes reviewers` | List all reviewers |
| `spikes inject <dir>` | Add/remove widget from HTML files |
| `spikes serve` | Local dev server (`--port`, `--marked`, `--cors-allow-origin`) |
| `spikes mcp serve` | Start MCP server for AI agent integration |
| `spikes pull/push/sync` | Sync with remote endpoint |
| `spikes share <dir>` | Upload to spikes.sh for instant sharing |
| `spikes login/logout/whoami` | Authentication management |
| `spikes upgrade/billing` | Pro tier subscription via Stripe |
| `spikes deploy cloudflare` | Scaffold self-hosted Worker + D1 |

All commands support `--json` for scripting. See [full CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## AI Agent Integration

Spikes speaks agent natively. Two ways to feed feedback into your AI workflow:

### MCP Server

`spikes mcp serve` starts a Model Context Protocol server (stdio transport) that exposes three tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_spikes` | List feedback with filters (page, rating, unresolved) |
| `get_element_feedback` | Get feedback for a specific CSS selector |
| `get_hotspots` | Find elements with the most feedback |

Agents like Claude and Cursor can query your feedback directly:

```bash
# Start the MCP server
spikes mcp serve

# In your agent's MCP config, add:
# { "command": "spikes", "args": ["mcp", "serve"] }
```

### Context Exports

Export structured markdown optimized for agent consumption:

```bash
# Cursor-optimized context
spikes export --format cursor-context > cursor-feedback.md

# Claude-optimized context  
spikes export --format claude-context > claude-feedback.md
```

Both formats include blocking issues, hotspots, and element-specific notes — structured for immediate agent action.

## GitHub Action

Gate CI on feedback quality. The `spikes-action` fails builds when unresolved negative feedback exceeds your threshold.

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  feedback-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: moritzbierling/spikes/action@v0.3.0
        with:
          threshold: 0           # Fail if any blocking spikes
          ignore-paths: ""     # Optional: pages to ignore
          require-resolution: false
```

See [action/README.md](action/README.md) for full documentation.

## Widget Attributes

```html
<script src="https://spikes.sh/spikes.js"
  data-project="my-app"
  data-position="bottom-right"
  data-color="#e74c3c"

## Architecture

Spikes has three components that work together or standalone:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   CLI       │────▶│   Widget    │◄────│   Worker    │
│  (Rust)     │     │  (Vanilla   │     │ (Cloudflare │
│             │     │    JS)      │     │  + D1)      │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
     │                                            │
     │          spikes.sh (hosted)                │
     └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CLI** — Rust binary for local development, spike management, and deployment. Stores spikes in `~/.local/share/spikes/`.

**Widget** — 8KB gzipped vanilla JS. Captures element selectors, bounding boxes, ratings, and comments. Works offline via localStorage.

**Worker** — Optional Cloudflare Worker + D1 backend for multi-reviewer sync, sharing, and hosted deployments. Lives in `spikes-hosted/`.

---

## Development

### CLI

```bash
cd cli
cargo build --release
cargo test              # 160+ tests
cargo run -- --help
```

### Widget

```bash
cd widget
# Edit src/spikes.js
# Test by running: spikes serve from the project root
```

### Worker

```bash
cd ../spikes-hosted/worker
npm install
npx vitest run          # 284+ tests
npx wrangler dev
```

---

## Self-Hosting

Want your own backend? One command:

```bash
spikes deploy cloudflare    # Creates spikes-worker/ directory
cd spikes-worker && npx wrangler deploy
```

See [Self-Hosting Guide](docs/self-hosting.md) for full setup with D1 database, authentication, and Stripe billing integration.

---

## What's Changed (Recent Overhaul)

- **Security**: PBKDF2 password hashing, path traversal fixes, XSS protection

- **Billing**: Stripe integration with Pro tier support
- **Testing**: 160 CLI tests + 284 worker tests
- **Architecture**: Modular worker with clean separation of concerns
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
